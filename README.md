# ☁️ Cloud Infrastructure Setup (IaC)

A comprehensive Infrastructure as Code (IaC) project using Terraform to automate the deployment of a cloud environment on AWS. This project provisions a fully functional infrastructure including compute resources, storage, and networking, making it ideal for DevOps professionals and cloud engineers.

## 🚀 Features

- **⚙️ Infrastructure as Code**: Automate cloud resource deployment using Terraform.
- **💻 EC2 Instances**: Provision virtual machines with auto-scaling and load balancing.
- **🗄️ S3 Buckets**: Secure object storage for static files or backups.
- **🔌 VPC and Networking**: Configure Virtual Private Cloud, subnets, and security groups for secure networking.
- **📈 Monitoring and Logging**: Set up CloudWatch for resource monitoring and centralized logging.
- **🔑 IAM Roles**: Secure access to resources using IAM roles and policies.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **🛠️ Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool for resource provisioning.
- **☁️ AWS**: Amazon Web Services for cloud infrastructure (EC2, S3, VPC, IAM, CloudWatch).
- **🔄 GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipelines for automating Terraform deployments.
- **🐳 Docker**: Containerization for running Terraform scripts in isolated environments.
- **🔐 AWS IAM**: Manage users and permissions securely.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **AWS Account**: Access to an AWS account with programmatic access (AWS CLI configured).
- **Terraform**: Installed on your local machine or run inside a Docker container.
- **AWS CLI**: For managing your AWS credentials and resources.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cloud-infrastructure-setup.git
    cd cloud-infrastructure-setup
    ```

2. Initialize Terraform:
    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

3. Configure AWS credentials (if not using an IAM role or already configured):
    ```bash
    aws configure
    ```

4. Plan the infrastructure changes:
    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```

5. Apply the infrastructure changes:
    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```

6. (Optional) Destroy the infrastructure when no longer needed:
    ```bash
    terraform destroy
    ```

## 🏗️ Infrastructure Components

- **💻 EC2 Instances**: Auto-scaled and load-balanced virtual machines.
- **🗄️ S3 Buckets**: Secure cloud storage for static assets or backups.
- **🔌 VPC**: Configured Virtual Private Cloud for secure and isolated networking.
- **📡 Load Balancer**: Distribute traffic between EC2 instances.
- **🔑 IAM Roles**: Managed permissions for secure access to resources.

## 🔗 GitHub Actions Integration

This project includes a **CI/CD pipeline** using GitHub Actions to automatically test and deploy the infrastructure changes whenever code is pushed.

- **🔄 Continuous Deployment**: Terraform plans and applies changes automatically.
- **✅ Testing**: Automated testing of infrastructure configurations.
